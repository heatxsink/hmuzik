# hmuzik

## Description

I grew tired of making directories, and moving files around. I then remembered Brian Hatfield's Step 3: Automate everything.

Thus...

I required a process that can be thrown at a directory of well tagged audio files, and have it organize/create a '%Artist%/%Album%' directory structure.


## Assumptions

1. I have only tested this on Linux, this should work on macOS (famous last words).
1. Using Go 1.22.0.
1. Contents of '--source' path has music files that are well tagged.


## Example Usage 

    $ hmuzik organize -s /home/ngranado/Music/lz -d /home/ngranado/Music/lz/organized 


## Collaboration

Pull requests are welcome, so are github issues.
